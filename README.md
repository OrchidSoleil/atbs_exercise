#The goal and source of this project

I've started learning Python from scratch with Automate the Boring Staff Book written by Al Sweigart https://alsweigart.com/.

The coding exercise you will find here were taken from the book, and I tried my best to resolve them only with the knowledge from the given chapter or earlier.

My goal was not to simply finish the tasks and move on, but to really ponder the solution and come up with clean, efficient and short code.

The first practical task appears in Chapter 3 'Functions', by the name 'The Collatz Sequence'.
